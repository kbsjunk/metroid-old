        <p>When used in the stop_times.txt file,
          the <strong>shape_dist_traveled</strong> field positions a stop as a
          distance from the first shape
          point. The <strong>shape_dist_traveled</strong> field represents a
          real distance traveled along the route in units such as feet or
          kilometers. For example, if a bus travels a distance of 5.25
          kilometers from the start of the shape to the stop,
          the <strong>shape_dist_traveled</strong> for the stop ID would be
          entered as "5.25". This information allows the trip planner
          to determine how much of the shape to draw when showing part of a
          trip on the map. The values used
          for <strong>shape_dist_traveled</strong> must increase along
          with <strong>stop_sequence</strong>: they cannot be used to show
          reverse travel along a route.<br>  <br> The units used

          must match the units that are used for this field in

  <h2>calendar_dates.txt </h2>
  <p class="note">File: <span class="optional">Optional</span></p>
  <p>The calendar_dates table allows you to explicitly activate or disable
  service IDs by date. You can use it in two ways.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Recommended: Use calendar_dates.txt in conjunction with calendar.txt,
      where calendar_dates.txt defines any exceptions to the default service
      categories defined in the <strong>calendar.txt</strong> file. If your
      service is generally regular, with a few changes on explicit dates (for
      example, to accomodate special event services, or a school schedule),
      this is a good approach.</li>
    <li>Alternate: Omit calendar.txt, and include ALL dates of service in
      calendar_dates.txt. If your schedule varies most days of the month, or
      you want to programmatically output service dates without specifying a
      normal weekly schedule, this approach may be preferable. </li>

  <h2>fare_rules.txt</h2>
  <p class="note">File: <span class="optional">Optional</span></p>
  <p>The fare_rules table allows you to specify how fares in
    fare_attributes.txt apply to an itinerary. Most fare structures use some
    combination of the following rules:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fare depends on origin or destination stations.  </li>
    <li>Fare depends on which zones the itinerary passes through.  </li>
    <li>Fare depends on which route the itinerary uses.  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>For examples that demonstrate how to specify a fare structure with
    fare_rules.txt and fare_attributes.txt,
    see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/FareExamples">FareExamples</a>
    in the GoogleTransitDataFeed open source project wiki.</p>

        <p>For example, you could use the origin_ID and destination_ID fields
          together to specify that fare class "b" is valid for travel
          between zones 3 and 4, and for travel between zones 3 and 5, the

        the <a href="#stops_fields">stops.txt</a> file. The fare ID is then
        associated with itineraries that pass through every contains_id

        <code>c,GRT,,,5<br>c,GRT,,,6<br>c,GRT,,,7</code></p>
      <p>Because all contains_id zones must be matched for the fare to apply,
        an itinerary that passes through zones 5 and 6 but not zone 7 would not
        have fare class "c". For more detail,

    an <a href="#agency_fields">agency.txt</a> file to provide information
    about the agencies that operate the services described by the
    feed. However, the publisher of the feed is sometimes a different entity
    than any of the agencies (in the case of regional aggregators). In
    addition, there are some fields that are really feed-wide settings, rather
    than agency-wide.</p>

        <p>The <strong>feed_publisher_name</strong> field contains the full

          in <a href="#agency_fields">agency.txt</a>.) GTFS-consuming

        <p>The <strong>feed_publisher_url</strong> field contains the URL of
          the feed publishing organization's website. (This may be the same as
          one of the <strong>agency_url</strong> values
          in <a href="#agency_fields">agency.txt</a>.) The value must be a
          fully qualified URL that includes <strong>http://</strong>
          or <strong>https://</strong>, and any special characters in the URL
          must be correctly
          escaped. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html">http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html</a>

        <p>The <strong>feed_lang</strong> field contains a IETF BCP 47 language
          code specifying the default language used for the text in this

          and other language-specific settings for the feed. For an

        <p>The feed provides complete and reliable schedule information for
          service in the period from the beginning of
          the <strong>feed_start_date</strong> day to the end of
          the <strong>feed_end_date</strong> day. Both days are given as dates
          in YYYYMMDD format as
          for <a href="#calendar_fields">calendar.txt</a>, or left empty if
          unavailable. The <strong>feed_end_date</strong> date must not precede
          the <strong>feed_start_date</strong> date if both are given. Feed
          providers are encouraged to give schedule data outside this period to
          advise of likely future service, but feed consumers should treat it
          mindful of its non-authoritative
          status. If <strong>feed_start_date</strong>
          or <strong>feed_end_date</strong> extend beyond the active calendar
          dates defined in calendar.txt and calendar_dates.txt, the feed is
          making an explicit assertion that there is no service for dates
          within the <strong>feed_start_date</strong>
          or <strong>feed_end_date</strong> range but not included in the
          active calendar dates.</p>
